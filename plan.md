# To Do
## For IT Expo
- Working Teacher/Admin View Prototype
  - Import Student Data from Spreadsheet (concept)
- Responsive UI
- Redesign/Practice Presentation
- Practice Questions/Responses
- Make a Custom Domain (through a Github Repo)

## Other/Long Term
- fill out all pages
- create a new user page(if we don't get that information from school)
- *create admin pages,ui for them, etc*
- make a github repo and host the website there (replit is getting too slow
- Add Google API in order to create acounts/logins
- Integrate SQL (Alechemy) Database

## ideas
- in the profile tab, create a passes container to view all passes(we could allow the teacher to set an amount of bathroom passes and let the user see how many they have left)
- create a node que maybe for each class
- a secure admin page where you can create and delete users (pip install Flask-SuperAdmin?)


## Add HTML/CSS for other pages (based off designs)
- Profile
- Classes
- About
- Pass in Progress
- Admin

## Add Flask Responsiveness from Hall Pass Mockup (Done)
Mockup link: https://replit.com/@susthebus/Hall-Pass#main.py


## Task assignment (who does what)
- 

## Comments!!
- Not a priority but obviously very convenient/useful
- It was mentioned that the username was basically the first name but what about people who have the same first names?

## Long term future
- Add responsiveness (website changes depending on screen size)
- Let teachers add a list of students at once
- Image (profile pictures)
- Landing page (after ending the hall pass)

- anything below will automatically get deleted

## TODO (auto generated):
- #TODO:  make more secure by storing an encrypted uuid for eatch token  at line 8 in file Token.py

- #TODO:  store user passwords encrypted, it is unsafe to store them raw in the database  at line 38 in file User.py
